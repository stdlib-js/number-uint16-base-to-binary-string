    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# Binary String

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Return a string giving the literal bit representation of an [unsigned 16-bit integer][integer].



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import toBinaryString from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/number-uint16-base-to-binary-string@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### toBinaryString( x )

Returns a `string` giving the literal bit representation of an [unsigned 16-bit integer][integer].

```javascript
import Uint16Array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-uint16@esm/index.mjs';

var a = new Uint16Array( [ 1, 4, 9 ] );

var str = toBinaryString( a[0] );
// returns '0000000000000001'

str = toBinaryString( a[1] );
// returns '0000000000000100'

str = toBinaryString( a[2] );
// returns '0000000000001001'
```

## Notes

-   Except for [typed arrays][typed-arrays], JavaScript does **not** provide native user support for [unsigned 16-bit integers][integer]. According to the [ECMAScript standard][ecma-262], `number` values correspond to [double-precision floating-point numbers][ieee754]. While this function is intended for [unsigned 16-bit integers][integer], the function will accept [floating-point][ieee754] values and represent the values **as if** they are [unsigned 16-bit integers][integer]. Accordingly, care **should** be taken to ensure that **only** nonnegative integer values less than `65536` (`2^16`) are provided.

    ```javascript
    var str = toBinaryString( 1 );
    // returns '0000000000000001'

    str = toBinaryString( 4 );
    // returns '0000000000000100'

    str = toBinaryString( 9 );
    // returns '0000000000001001'

    str = toBinaryString( 65535 );
    // returns '1111111111111111'
    ```
